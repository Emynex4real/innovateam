What I changed

- Added `tailwindcss-animate` to `tailwind.config.js` plugins.
- Added a minimal `shadcn.config.js` to help the shadcn CLI when run in manual projects.

Manual steps to finish installation

1. The project detected here is a Create React App without an officially supported framework by the shadcn CLI, so the automated `init` failed. To use shadcn components, follow these manual steps:

2. Run the CLI to add individual components once you've manually configured styles:

   npx shadcn@latest add button input card checkbox label textarea separator

   If the CLI still cannot detect your framework, you can copy components from the shadcn repo into `src/components/ui` and adapt them.

3. Ensure your global CSS (`src/index.css`) includes the Tailwind base/components/utilities (already present) and optionally import shadcn animations or styles if you copy them.

4. Install recommended packages (already installed in this session):

   npm install class-variance-authority tailwindcss-animate

5. Restart your dev server (if running):

   npm start

Notes

- I created `shadcn.config.js` to provide a hint for the CLI; the CLI may still refuse to run against non-supported projects. If you want, I can copy a set of shadcn components into `src/components/ui` and wire up helpers (cn, button variants, etc.) for you automatically.
