## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "GEMINI_API_KEY not found"
**Solution:** Check `server/.env` has `GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBp6zQHjSI0OCwHJNJzeENc1AWEYs2A4wQ`

### Issue: Questions not generating
**Solution:** 
1. Check backend console for errors
2. Verify Gemini API key is valid
3. Check internet connection

### Issue: Wallet not deducting
**Solution:** Check transaction was created in database

### Issue: Questions format wrong
**Solution:** Backend should return questions with `correct_answer` field (not `correctAnswer`)
