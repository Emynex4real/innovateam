# Admin Data Issue - FIXED

## What was the problem?
The admin page was showing dummy data instead of real user data because:

1. **Response Format Mismatch**: The backend was returning `{ success: true, data: users }` but the frontend expected `{ success: true, users: users }`

2. **Missing Transactions**: The new user "Opadiya Iyanuoluwa" had no transactions, so they wouldn't appear in transaction lists

## What was fixed?

### 1. Backend Response Format
Fixed `server/routes/admin.routes.js`:
- Users endpoint now returns `{ success: true, users: [...] }`
- Transactions endpoint now returns `{ success: true, transactions: [...] }`

### 2. Frontend Service
Fixed `src/services/admin.service.js`:
- Removed duplicate `getTransactions` method
- Updated to handle correct response format

### 3. Sample Data
- Added a sample transaction for the new user "Opadiya Iyanuoluwa"
- Transaction ID: `tx_1753972542306`

## Current Real Data

### Users (3 total):
1. **Admin User** - admin@example.com (admin)
2. **Michael Balogun Temidayo** - emynex4real@gmail.com (user)
3. **Opadiya Iyanuoluwa** - michaelbalogun34@gmail.com (user) ← NEW USER

### Transactions (3 total):
1. Admin purchase - ₦5,000 (completed)
2. Admin refund - ₦7,500 (pending)  
3. Opadiya purchase - ₦2,500 (completed) ← NEW TRANSACTION

## Next Steps
1. Restart your server: `cd server && npm start`
2. Refresh your admin page
3. You should now see all real users and transactions

## Future Transactions
When users make real transactions through your app, they will automatically appear in the admin panel since the system now reads from the actual data files.
